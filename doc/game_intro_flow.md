## The fight
While your team celebrates, a player of the opposing team runs toward your
teammate. You see what's going on and run to his aid. You get there just in
time, knocking the furious player to the ground, and a brawl ensues. As the
refs break up the fight, you get thrown to the ground... hard.

## The replacement
The next morning, you cna barely move. Something isn't right in your back.
A couple of days later, it's not getting better. There's no way you can play
in the Championship. Needing a replacement, you look around the area to see
who can take your place in the championship game.

surgery, but your playing days are over. You still have an eye for talent
and a mind for the game, and it's your goal to take this 7-on-7 football
team, get it to semi-pro, and eventually work your way to champions of the
highest level in the sport. It's time to go...
